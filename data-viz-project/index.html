    <h1>Is total offense the key to figuring out the winner of the NFC East?</h1>
    <h2> A look into the relationship between offensive success and place in division standings</h2>
    <h3>By Nathan Schwartz</h3>
    <p>The NFC East is one of the NFL's most competitive divisions, and over the last two decades, there hasn't been a repeat winner. The Philadelphia Eagles were the last team to repeat as winners of the division, winning it every year between 2001-2004.</p>
    <p>
    Since then, its been a mystery as to why the standings have been inconsistent. With the NFL being an offense-driven league, it's plausible to think that the team that averages the most offensive yards per game would win the division. So, below are each team's total offense averages per game in the 2013-2022 seasons, followed by their place in the division standings during that same timeframe.</p>
